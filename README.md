# Assessing Growth and Downside Risk in Oil-Related Middle East and Central Asian Economies
This repository implements a pipeline to analyze real GDP growth in the Middle East and Central Asia, using the IMF’s [Middle East and Central Asia Regional Economic Outlook](https://data.imf.org/en/datasets/IMF.MCD:MCDREO) (MCDREO) dataset for years 2000 to 2030. `data.R` filters the raw data to five oil-related regional aggregates and creates necessary variables for later analysis. `estimation.R` calculates summary statistics by region and period and runs two-sample t-tests comparing pre-2020 and post-2020 growth for each region. `simulation.R` generates linear and ARIMA(1,0,0) forecasts for 2020-2030 and summarizes the probability of at least one negative year and average simulated growth by region. `plot.R` produces faceted plots combining the historical data, IMF projections, and our simulated forecasts to visualize differences across regions. Lastly, `utils.R` sources all scripts, runs the whole pipeline, and returns the main tables and figures.
